# 👋 Arthur Maffre

Welcome to my personal GitHub repository! This space serves as a central hub for my research, prototypes, and creative explorations across **AI, economics, optimization, and systems design**.

## 🔍 About Me

I’m Arthur Maffre — a research master’s student at **Mila** and **Université de Montréal**, supervised by **Margarida Carvalho**. My work bridges **Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets)**, **bilevel optimization**, and **dynamic portfolio management**, with a focus on making machine learning models more interpretable and decision-oriented.

I’m passionate about:
- 🧠 AI for structured decision-making
- 📈 Quantitative finance & portfolio generation
- 🧩 Game theory & economic optimization
- 🧮 Mathematical modeling in complex systems
- 🚀 Long-term vision: impactful research and real-world applications

## 🧠 Vision

I aim to develop tools and models that map the solution space — not just maximize a function. My goal is to build **interpretable**, **robust**, and **scalable** solutions to problems where economics, AI, and complexity intersect.
