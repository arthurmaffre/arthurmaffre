# 👋 Arthur Maffre

Welcome to my personal GitHub repository! This space serves as a central hub for my research, prototypes, and creative explorations across **AI, economics, optimization, and systems design**.

## 🔍 About Me

I’m Arthur Maffre — a research master’s student at **Mila** and **Université de Montréal**, supervised by [**Margarida Carvalho**](https://github.com/mxmmargarida). I come from a background in economics, where I developed a deep interest in analytical thinking and the logic of decision-making under uncertainty. For me, rationality isn’t about rigidity — it’s about understanding the world in a way that respects individual choices and freedoms. I enjoy engaging in open discussions that challenge ideas and reveal why, behind seemingly abstract models, economics is ultimately about people, choices, and trade-offs. Today, my research bridges **Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets)**, **bilevel optimization**, and **dynamic portfolio management**, with a focus on making machine learning models more interpretable and decision-oriented.

I’m passionate about:
- 🧠 AI for structured decision-making
- 📈 Quantitative finance & portfolio generation
- 🧩 Game theory & economic optimization
- 🧮 Mathematical modeling in complex systems
- 🚀 Long-term vision: impactful research and real-world applications

## 🧠 Vision

I aim to develop tools and models that map the solution space — not just maximize a function. My goal is to build **interpretable**, **robust**, and **scalable** solutions to problems where economics, AI, and complexity intersect.

## 🎯 My Research Levels System

To organize my ideas and research projects, I use a **5-level system** that helps track progress from early exploration to polished work:

| Level | Description                                   |
|-------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1     | 🌱 Idea stage — rough notes, spontaneous insights, and unstructured thoughts. |
| 2     | 🧪 Exploratory phase — initial experiments, toy models, and feasibility checks. |
| 3     | 🔧 Prototyping — focused implementations, small-scale validation, and initial write-ups. |
| 4     | 📈 Refinement — robust models, formal results, and preparation for dissemination (talks, reports). |
| 5     | 🚀 Publication-ready — polished papers, arXiv submissions, or open-source releases. |

This system helps me prioritize, iterate, and communicate progress effectively across projects.
